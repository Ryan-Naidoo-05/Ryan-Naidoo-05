### **📂 My Projects**
Here are a few things I’ve worked on:  
- 📈 [Wine Quality Analysis](https://github.com/Ryan-Naidoo-05/Wine-Quality-Analysis): Performed EDA and used Machine Learning to plot a supervised segmentation algorithm onto a wine dataset. Utilised R and RMarkdown, aswell as ggplot, rpart and tidyverse to help me with my study and investigation into what really makes wine good!
- 📉 Sales forecasting model and intake predictor: Currently in development, coming soon! Using linear regression to model elasticity and performing forecasting on a stock and sales data set for a retail company!
